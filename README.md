# Plymouth-OpenRC-for-artix
This is to add OpenRC support to Plymouth in Artix linux. You will still need to install plymouth or plymouth-git from arch before installing these files.

These files work for my system. Don't use it if you are new to Linux and I am not going to provide the steps to install them. But its simple if you search from the internet about how to setup Plymouth, /etc/local.d and /etc/init.d. In addition, the Before / After in the service files may need to further update to make it working in a better state.

## Note for ly
This is different. You do not need to add any of the special other files, just use this as your ly startup script.
